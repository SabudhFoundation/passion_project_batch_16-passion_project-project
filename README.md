# Federated Learning for Intelligent Transportation Systems

## Overview

This project presents a privacy-preserving traffic forecasting framework using **Federated Learning (FL)** and **Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs)**. The objective is to accurately predict future traffic flow while preserving data privacy by ensuring that raw traffic sensor data remains localized on client devices and is never shared with a central server.

Two federated deep learning architectures are implemented and compared:

### 1. GNN-GRU-KAN

* Graph Attention Network (GAT)
* Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
* Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) Prediction Head

### 2. STGAT+GCN

* Graph Attention Network (GAT)
* Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
* Fully Connected Prediction Head

Experiments were conducted using the **California PeMS Traffic Dataset** under a federated learning environment utilizing the **FedAvg aggregation algorithm**.
